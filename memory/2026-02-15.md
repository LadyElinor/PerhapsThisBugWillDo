# 2026-02-15

- Reachability/physics diagnostics checkpoint:
  - Computed from `results/reachability/physics/pilot_2026-02-14.csv`:
    - late escapes (`escape_time > 1000` among successful seeds): 29 / 95 = 0.3053
    - flips from hit@1000=0 to hit@10000=1: 29 total
    - policy rates (from this file):
      - greedy: 0.2833 @1000 -> 0.4000 @10000 (7 flips)
      - anneal: 0.3833 @1000 -> 0.5000 @10000 (7 flips)
      - tempered: 0.4333 @1000 -> 0.6833 @10000 (15 flips)
- Interpretation logged: plateau is not real in this dataset; meaningful late-tail escapes exist.
- Limitation logged: mode concentration (`mode_id` top-k mass) could not be computed from the available pilot CSV because per-exit `mode_id` records were not present.
- Implemented minimal physics exits instrumentation in `scripts/pilot_runner.py`:
  - Added `results/reachability/physics/exits_<date>.csv` output.
  - One probe per `(seed, policy)` with default `M=256` proposals.
  - Logged fields: `seed, policy, run_id, probe_time, probe_budget, proposal_idx, mode_id, deltaE_plus, accessible, accepted, accepted_weight`.
  - Added CLI args: `--physics-probe-m`, `--physics-probe-window`.
- Reran pilot with instrumentation (`--seeds 60`, date `2026-02-14`) and computed concentration diagnostics from exits log:
  - Accepted-only top1/top3 by policy:
    - greedy: 0.164 / 0.465
    - anneal: 0.148 / 0.442
    - tempered: 0.171 / 0.451
  - Accessible-only top1/top3 by policy:
    - greedy: 0.164 / 0.465
    - anneal: 0.147 / 0.437
    - tempered: 0.171 / 0.452
  - Weighted (`accepted_weight`) shows same pattern; unique modes = 8 for all policies.
- Mechanistic conclusion updated:
  - Current physics toy appears barrier-limited (policy affects crossing efficiency/time), not connectivity-limited (pathway usage nearly policy-invariant under current `mode_id` coarse-graining).
- Wrote report-ready negative-result summary + figure/table spec to:
  - `results/reachability/PHYSICS_NEGATIVE_RESULT_2026-02-15.md`
- Implemented function-level upgrades from fork-point findings:
  - Added richer physics exit signatures in `scripts/pilot_runner.py`:
    - `--physics-mode-signature {coarse,mode_energy}`
    - `--physics-energy-bins` (default 4)
    - exits log now includes `mode_key` and `energy_bin`.
  - Added probe-policy controls:
    - `--physics-probe-mode {first_hit_minus_W,fixed_1000,final_budget}`
    - existing `--physics-probe-window` retained.
  - Added weighted connectivity metrics to pilot output (backward-compatible extra columns):
    - `exit_entropy_H_acc`, `exit_entropy_H_acc_weighted`, `exit_entropy_H_accessible`
    - `C_saddle_acc`, `C_saddle_acc_weighted`, `C_saddle_accessible`
    - `exit_unique_n_accessible`, `accepted_weight_total`, `mode_signature`.
  - Added one-shot fork diagnostic script `scripts/_forkpoint_diagnostics.py`:
    - Computes late ratio, flips, reachability lift, accepted/accessed/weighted concentration.
    - Emits `FORKPOINT_READOUT.md` + `forkpoint_summary.csv`.
    - Includes guardrails: required columns, policy presence, non-degenerate mode count.
  - Added `--fork-diagnostics` to `pilot_runner.py` to auto-run diagnostics after a pilot.
  - Smoke-tested end-to-end run in `results/reachability_test2/` with analysis + fork diagnostics.
- Completed full phase-diagram workflow and stabilized conclusions:
  - Multi-probe and estimator panels showed local snapshot Λ-collapse does not predict τ in onset-dominated regimes.
  - Hazard panel identified `M_acc_w` as strongest predictor in broad regimes.
  - 8-cell sweep + local refinement identified a barrier-emergent island near baseline T and access ≈ 0.65.
  - Stage-2 120-seed trace showed sharp/narrow barrier-emergent island at baseline T (peak around access 0.65), with collapse outside ±0.01.
  - Low-T drift mini-sweep (120 seeds) supported ridge collapse (not drift) at low T.
  - Mechanism probes ruled out easy explanations (global barrier spread, route entropy, logM variance) and pointed to subtle joint predictor alignment effects.
- Created and pushed project repo state to GitHub:
  - New remote `origin`: `https://github.com/LadyElinor/DSGenerator-O.git`
  - Kept previous remote as `cer-telemetry`.
  - Pushed commit `9f928b3` on `main` with scripts + readouts + phase artifacts.
- Key durable scientific learning:
  - DSG-Ω physics toy is phase-structured: onset-dominated over most space, with a finite-temperature narrow barrier-emergent island where barrier terms are conditionally useful.
  - Naive universal single-scalar Λ-collapse is falsified for broad regimes; two-factor (exposure + conditional barrier term) framing fits observed behavior better.
- Major project pivot completed: lunar robotics (weevil-focused) established as active track.
  - Verified and ran robotics tooling in `results/GPT/Robotics/`:
    - `lunar_integrated_weevil_leg.py`
    - `morphology_harness.py`
  - Fixed Windows encoding issues in robotics scripts by enforcing UTF-8 writes.
- Implemented Weevil-Lunar v0.3 contact/control upgrades:
  - Extended `regolith_contact_model.py` with preload-aware + directional anchoring hooks:
    - directional forward/lateral shear outputs
    - directional cone angles
    - anchored-state logic by preload threshold
  - Upgraded `weevil_lunar_tests.py` to directional slope gates and rescue sweep.
  - Generated `mare_rescue_profile.md` and updated test results.
- Built full `weevil-lunar/` blueprint package:
  - system docs, subsystem specs, ICDs, mission profiles, BOM stubs.
  - verification matrix + traceability CSV + sync report.
- Closed all planned traceability TODOs by implementing and wiring additional executable test harnesses:
  - `test_steep_slope_state_machine.py`
  - `test_dust_ingress_endurance.py`
  - `test_thermal_vac_cycle.py`
  - `test_actuation_bench.py`
  - `test_power_comms_profile.py`
  - `test_autonomy_health_planner.py`
  - integrated `run_gate_check.py` with generated gate reports.
  - Traceability status now: 31 rows, 0 TODO/planned; statuses include pass, baseline-fail, rescue-envelope, partial-pass.
- Repo operations completed:
  - Switched/preserved remotes (`cer-telemetry`, `dsgen-o`, `origin`).
  - Pushed Weevil-Lunar-focused history to:
    - `https://github.com/LadyElinor/PerhapsThisBugWillDo` (main)
  - Pruned non-Weevil tracked assets (CER/reachability artifacts) from target repo main branch.
  - Updated root `README.md` and added `requirements.txt` for Weevil-Lunar quickstart.
- Added CAD/export readiness artifacts under `weevil-lunar/cad/`:
  - `weevil_leg_params.yaml`
  - `README_export.md`
  - `PMI_priority.md`
  - `cleat_sketch_spec.md`
  - `freecad_build_steps.md`
  - `urdf_inertial_defaults.yaml`
- Pre-compaction memory flush note:
  - Durable state is now Weevil-Lunar-first in `PerhapsThisBugWillDo` with repo-level docs, deps, verification, and CAD export conventions aligned for AP242/URDF handoff.
