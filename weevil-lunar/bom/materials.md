# Materials Notes (v0.3)

## Foot subsystem
- Replaceable wear surfaces preferred
- Directional cleat inserts should prioritize abrasion resistance
- Flexure/compliance elements should be vacuum-compatible

## Structural subsystem
- Favor thermally conductive structural path where possible
- Manage mass-growth from larger foot radius options (mare rescue)

## Tribology/sealing
- Vacuum-compatible dry lubrication assumptions
- Dust-tolerant interface design prioritized over tight-contact seals alone
