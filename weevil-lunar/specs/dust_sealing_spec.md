# Dust Sealing Spec (v0.3)

## Purpose
Define dust mitigation and sealing requirements for abrasive lunar regolith exposure.

## Requirements
- REQ-DUST-001: Mobility-critical joints shall resist dust ingress over endurance cycles.
- REQ-DUST-002: Wear surfaces shall be serviceable/replaceable.
- REQ-DUST-003: Sealing strategy shall remain compatible with vacuum operation.

## Design guidance
- Labyrinth-style geometric barriers at interfaces
- Shielding near high-splash regolith zones
- Vacuum-compatible dry lubrication strategy
- Replaceable foot pads and inspectable wear interfaces

## Verification
- Dust ingress endurance test with torque/binding metrics
- Post-test teardown inspection and wear scoring
- Functional retest after abrasion exposure
