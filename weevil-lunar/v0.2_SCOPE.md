# Weevil-Lunar v0.2 Scope

## Objective
Deliver a defensible v0.2 prototype package with:
1. Earth-analog bench hardware bring-up
2. Calibrated traction/sinkage validation workflow
3. Reproducible CAD-to-verification pipeline
4. Explicit evidence-tier separation

## Evidence tiers
- **Tier A (Integration):** system/build/pipeline correctness and reproducibility
- **Tier B (Physics):** calibrated trend/ranking evidence from bench experiments
- **Tier C (Mission inference):** extrapolations beyond measured regimes (must be labeled speculative)

## Top-level pass criteria
- Bench executes press / press+twist / press+twist+vibe recipes repeatably.
- At least 2 soils x 3 preload levels captured.
- Metrics produced: `F_peak`, `k_t`, `x_slip`, `E_diss`, `Δz`, cycle degradation.
- Model comparison recovers at least one correct strategy ordering and one correct preload trend in measured regimes.
- Clean checkout reproducibility from params/config to report.

## Weekly gates (time + budget + technical)
Each week requires all three gates:
1. **Time gate:** weekly critical path completed by target date.
2. **Budget gate:** spend remains within planned cap.
3. **Technical gate:** acceptance tests pass.

If any gate fails, the week is marked red and next-week scope is reduced.

## Non-goals for v0.2
- Full lunar-grade terramechanics validation
- Flight-certification claims
- Unbounded morphology search beyond defined matrix

## Kill-switch logic
- End of Week 3: if repeatability cannot reach workable CV bounds, downgrade to Tier A-first release.
- End of Week 4: if no lock-in signature appears in any regime, publish as negative-result constrained release.

## External reviewer checklist (summary)
- Claim-to-artifact mapping present
- Evidence tier labels present in all reports
- Calibration bounds documented
- Repro instructions validated on clean checkout
