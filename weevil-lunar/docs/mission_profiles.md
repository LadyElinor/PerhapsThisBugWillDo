# Mission Profiles (v0.3)

## Profile A: Pathfinder Traverse
- Goal: characterize traction envelope across representative regolith classes
- Priority: reliability, slip/margin telemetry, conservative gait
- Success: waypoint completion with bounded slip and no unrecovered stalls

## Profile B: Steep Slope Probe
- Goal: validate directional anchoring and slope gates near 45°
- Priority: anchoring state machine correctness, recovery behavior
- Success: pass directional slope margins and complete ascent/hold/retreat routine

## Profile C: Hazard-Tolerant Recon
- Goal: operate with delayed comms and degraded conditions
- Priority: autonomy safety modes and health-aware planning
- Success: complete mission segment under comm dropouts and injected faults
