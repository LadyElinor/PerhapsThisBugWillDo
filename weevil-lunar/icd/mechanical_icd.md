# Mechanical ICD (v0.3)

## Scope
Mechanical interfaces among chassis, legs, feet, and serviceable wear components.

## Interface definitions
- Leg mount pattern and allowable tolerances
- Foot quick-swap interface geometry
- Cable/harness routing keep-out zones
- Twisting/clearance envelope for screw-joint deployment

## Constraints
- Dust shields must not interfere with full required ROM
- Replaceable pads must be field-serviceable without full leg disassembly
- Thermal expansion effects shall be considered in tolerance stack
