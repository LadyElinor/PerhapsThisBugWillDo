# Parameter Sweep Robustness Report

Sensitivity sweep over regolith/contact and preload/gravity
scaling around nominal settings.

- total_cases: 81
- pass_cases (margin>=1.05): 0
- pass_rate: 0.00%

## Notes
- This is a reduced-order robustness screen, not full terramechanics calibration.
- Next step: compare against Bekker/Wong-Reece baseline envelopes and simulant ranges.
